# Cyclone-Tracking-using-satellite-images

This repository is dedicated to the study of **tropical cyclones**, combining advanced data visualization and machine learning techniques:

---

## Data Visualization

An **interactive Power BI dashboard** serves as the front-end for exploring spatial and temporal trends in cyclone data. This allows users to quickly gain insights into cyclone frequency, intensity, and geographical paths.

---

## Deep Learning Application

We provide a **deep learning model implementation** for the precise estimation of **atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs)**. This model is designed to enhance the accuracy of atmospheric movement analysis, which is critical for forecasting and climate research.

## Repository Contents (Example Structure)

* `PowerBI/`: Contains the Power BI dashboard file (`.pbix`) and its supporting data.
* `DeepLearningModel/`: Includes the model code, training scripts, and necessary weight files for AMV estimation.

The dashboard integrates historical data from the IBTrACS repository with near-real-time updates collected from the official mosdac.gov.in portal.
